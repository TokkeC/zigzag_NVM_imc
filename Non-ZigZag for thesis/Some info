ReRAM Write is generally with 50-100 ns pulses
    For Filamentary around 10-100 ns (but not used according to prof)
    For OxRAM (commercialized) a bit higher 50-100 ns
    For 3D Crosspoint ReRAM (Intel Optane etc.) 100-200 ns
    Very new fast devices (so unimportant now) 1-10 ns


ReRAM Reading is generally with 5-50 ns pulses -> 3-50 for production-grade
    Depending to difference between HRS and LRS
    On device level actually 5-10 ns, but in arrays it gets a bit bigger
