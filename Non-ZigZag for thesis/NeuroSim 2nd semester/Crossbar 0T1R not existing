There are 0T1R ReRAM arrays actually fabricated to do certain experiments.
But not fully integrated to actually have a fully working CIM array, macro and chip.
So there are barely any (non simulated) results and numbers to be found.

The reason for this are the following:
- Technological complexity, because it needs precise control of the resisitve states of the RRAM cell.
- Manufacturing constraints, foundaries are in general not able to actually produce the cells at this nanoscale.
- Limited Commercial Interest, 1T1R and 2T2R are used more often as they are more reliable and already used a lot.
- Experimental research state, Still in first stage of testing and it's expensive to fabricate the chips to do actual research on.
- Cost and Risk, it is expensive and risky to fabricate those chips, first simulations happen way more to not spend the money and time to actually fabricate the chip.
